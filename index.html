          <h3 id="about">About Me</h3>
          <p>I graduated from Texas A&M University and attained a bachelors
            degree in Biology, as well as a minor in Applied Teaching & Learning
            in STEM. Soon after graduating, I moved to Silicon Valley, CA and
            began teaching. The move became an eye opener for me as I was able
            to view and learn firsthand the advanacements made in the technology
            industry. This sparked my interest & I took it upon myself to further
            my education and take a few coding classes. Fast forward to the
            present, and I am now pursuing a career in software development at
            Thinkful!</p>

            <p>As a student at Thinkful and a former teacher, I've learned to be
              flexible, creative, and how important it is to be a team player
              when working with other creative minds that are striving for the
              same goals.</p>

            <p>Aside from software development, a few of my hobbies and interests
              include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Singing and dancing</li>
                <li>Watching movies/musicals</li>
                <li>Going to the gym or being active at home</li>
              </ul>
